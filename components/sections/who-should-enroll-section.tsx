            We used to be video editors, working with clients every day, loving
            the hustle... until we hit a wall.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm font-medium leading-relaxed">
            At first, freelancing felt like freedom. But over time? We realized
            the harsh truth:{" "}
            <strong className="text-white">it doesn't scale.</strong> We were
            trading time for money â€” and there was no way to grow without
            burning out.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            That's when we noticed something crazy...
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Some of our clients{" "}
            <strong className="text-white">(selling digital products)</strong>{" "}
            were making thousands â€” from <em>just one Instagram post</em>.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            We helped them edit those videos.
            <br />
            We saw the numbers.
            <br />
            We knew it worked.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            So, we asked ourselves:
            <br />
            <strong className="text-white">
              "Why are we building someone else's business, when we could build
              our own?"
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            That's when everything changed.
            <br />
            We stopped freelancing and went all in on selling digital products â€”
            templates, guides, eBooks, and more.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Within <strong className="text-white">2 months</strong>, we made
            over <strong className="text-white">$6,000</strong> â€” from a brand
            new <strong className="text-white">IG account</strong>.<br />
            No ads. No fancy tools.
            <br />
            Just our system â€” and consistent content.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            But here's the thing:
            <br />
            We had <em>no mentor</em>. No course. <em>No roadmap</em>.<br />
            We made mistakes. We wasted time.
            <br />
            And we know how frustrating that feels.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            That's why we created{" "}
            <strong className="text-white">
              DPA â€” The Digital Product Academy
            </strong>
            .
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            It's everything we wish we had when we started â€”<br />
            The exact strategies, systems, and shortcuts we used to go from
            stuck freelancers to digital product sellers.
