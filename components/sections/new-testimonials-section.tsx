I've never sold this much in such a short period before and now my last 3 reels I have had that happening. But the best part about this course is that it taught me I know what I need to do each day to bring in leads and sales, and have finally figured out how to make my business WORK! So I just wanted to let you know the process you teach and the heaviness of struggling in my business has lifted and I'm just so grateful I found your course!! ðŸ’—"}
